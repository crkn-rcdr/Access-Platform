# Access Object Storage scheme

The preservation-access platform split means that the generation and maniuplation of images and metadata on the access platform can no longer be thought of as a by-product of the preservation process. As such, a scheme for storing access images and metadata manually derived from what is available in the preservation platform is needed.

CIHM::Smelter will accept access deposit requests from a queue, retrieve the relevant data from the preservation platform, split and manipulate preservation METS records, and store the results in Swift using the following scheme.

* /v1/access/metadata/$collection
  * /dmdMARC.xml
  * /dmdDC.xml
* /v1/access/metadata/$manifest
  * /dmdMARC.xml
  * /dmdDC.xml
  * /dmdISSUEINFO.xml
  * /dmdPARL.json
* /v1/access/metadata/$canvas
  * /ocrALTO.xml
  * /ocrTXTMAP.xml
  * /dmdHERITAGE.json
* /v1/access/files/$file.$ext

Couch databases for collections, manifests, and canvases will be populated with the required information to link these objects together.

$collection, $manifest, $canvas. $file are [noids](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Noid/noid), which will be generated by our [Noid service](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/noid).

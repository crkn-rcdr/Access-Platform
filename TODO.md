1. Move basically the whole of lapin to a package. This will let us do some neat stuff with service-specific Docker images, while still letting us use the Lapin router type in admin.
2. See if you can get the service Docker containers going.
3. Maybe, just maybe, switch data to suretype. I think it'll work the best.
4. Document what's up with data.
5. Document what's up with couch-utils.
6. Document what's up with lapin.
7. Add auth stuff to proof-of-concept. Ensure that it can get passed as headers to lapin.
8. Come up with a way to test lapin.

# Access Object Storage scheme

The preservation-access platform split means that the generation and maniuplation of images and metadata on the access platform can no longer be thought of as a by-product of the preservation process. As such, a scheme for storing access images and metadata manually derived from what is available in the preservation platform is needed.

CIHM::Smelter will accept access deposit requests from a queue, retrieve the relevant data from the preservation platform, split and manipulate preservation METS records, and store the results in Swift using the following scheme.

* /v1/AUTH_crkn/access-metadata/$noid
  * /dmdMARC.xml
  * /dmdDC.xml
  * /dmdISSUEINFO.xml
  * /ocrALTO.xml
  * /ocrTXTMAP.xml
* /v1/AUTH_crkn/access-files/$noid.$ext

Couch databases for collections, manifests, and canvases will be populated with the required information to link these objects together.

$noid is [a noid](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Noid/noid), generated by our [Noid service](https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/noid). It can identify a collection, manifest, or canvas.

Note: Swift containers are generally created under AUTH_crkn, and access controls used to determine what specific users have access.  Different applications should be using different user IDs so that we can grant only the access required for that specific application.

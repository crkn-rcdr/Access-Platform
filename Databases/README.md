# Database schemas

Schemas for access platform databases can be found here.

Ideally, databases should be defined using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). Discussion about schemas can take place in issues/PRs.

## Testing

```
$ npm install
OR
$ yarn install

$ node test.js -s <path_to_schema> -f <path_to_json_file>
```

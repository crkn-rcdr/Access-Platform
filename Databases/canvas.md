# canvas data

Database fields are what was previously in 'internalmeta' in the array within hammer.json index above 0.

## Fields to be stored within couch documents

* canonicalDownload - reference to download, usually a PDF file
* canonicalDownloadMime - MIME type of download
* canonicalDownloadSize - size (bytes) of download
* canonicalMaster - reference to master image
* canonicalMasterHeight - heigh of image
* canonicalMasterMime - MIME type of image
* canonicalMasterSize - size (bytes) of image
* canonicalMasterWidth - width of image

* tx - text-only string extracted from OCR XML

## Fields that should be deprecated and/or stored/generated elsewhere

* pkey - multiple manifests could be parent.
* label - labels will be in the array of canvases within manifests
* type - since databases are separate, the type="page" from METS is redundant as all canvases are of that type in METS.
* seq - sequence becomes the index within the manifest, so shouldn't be stored here.
* key - This is the manifest slug plus index within manifest.
* depositor - this is a component of the slug of the manifest
* identifier - array of identifiers (slugs of manifests, without depositor, with a sequence index appended)

If we use any of these fields within cosearch(Solr) or copresentation then they can be generated by Press.
